# Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is on the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane) which is calcultaed until it either hits the max aloted number of iterations or it tends to infinity. The number of iterations is the pixel value and in this example is set to a color corisponding to the unber of iterations it takes "excape"

The mandel brot set only exits with in the area of -2,2 and 2,-2


todo:
- finish writing this doc on how it works with lot sof pictues and explanations
- find good setting for the colors looking for more orange and red but seem to get black and blue
- add more color iteration options
- add more fracals to the ones you can generate
- add to website and update images
