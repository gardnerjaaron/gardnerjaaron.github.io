Hi! I’m Aaron Gardner, a passionate junior developer and college student at the
University of Texas at Arlington, with a love for computers, animals, and cooking.
Currently, I am a visual integration Co-op at CAE, where I have learned the practical
realities of software development, including API design and build performance tuning.
In my personal projects, I have a passion for deeplearning for remote sensing analysis,
and building tools to improve my daily workflow. When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy hiking,
camping, and experimenting with new recipes.
